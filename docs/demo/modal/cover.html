        <h2>My Sister the Serial Killer</h2>

        <p>
          "Femi makes three you know. Three and they label you a serial killer."
        </p>

        <p>
          When Korede's dinner is interrupted one night by a distress call from
          her sister, Ayoola, she knows what's expected of her: bleach, rubber
          gloves, nerves of steel and a strong stomach. This'll be the third
          boyfriend Ayoola's dispatched in, quote, self-defence and the third
          mess that her lethal little sibling has left Korede to clear away. She
          should probably go to the police for the good of the menfolk of
          Nigeria, but she loves her sister and, as they say, family always
          comes first. Until, that is, Ayoola starts dating the fit doctor where
          Korede works as a nurse. Korede's long been in love with him, and
          isn't prepared to see him wind up with a knife in his back: but to
          save one would mean sacrificing the other...
